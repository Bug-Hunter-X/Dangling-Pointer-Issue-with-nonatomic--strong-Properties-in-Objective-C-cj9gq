To address this, use techniques like weak references or carefully manage the lifecycles of the objects assigned to such properties. Hereâ€™s an improved version:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    NSString *tempString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, %@", someVariable];
    self.myString = tempString; // Assign to self.myString after creating tempString
    // ... some code ...
    // Now, myString will not retain someVariable; it'll just reference it.
}
```

By using a `weak` property, we avoid the retain cycle.  The `myString` property will point to the string, but won't keep it alive. Alternatively, consider managing the object's lifecycle more explicitly (for example, by making `myString` a strong property and keeping a reference to it for its entire lifecycle, ensuring it won't be deallocated prematurely).  Choosing the best strategy depends on your specific code context.
